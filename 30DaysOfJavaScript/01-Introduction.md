## Context
I believe before learning anything, you must know the history because if you don't know why this thing exist then you are learning that thing just to complete your tasks.

## History of JavaScript
JavaScript was developed by Brendan Eich in 1995. It was developed for Netscape Navigator (Browser) after it was having a tough competition with Microsoft's Internet Explorer. One interesting fact is that JavaScript was developed in 10 days as a project of Sun Microsystems (Now owned by Oracle). 
Javascript is both scripting and programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages. 99% of the websites uses JavaScript as their client-side language. However, it can be used for both Client-Side (Frontend) and Server-Side (Backend).

## Features of JavaScript
- JavaScript is a synchronous, single-threaded programming language. However, there are some techniques to perform asynchronous tasks. (We'll discuss about it in later chapters)
- It is an Interpreted Language.
- It is an Object Oriented programming language.
- Functions are the heart of JavaScript and are treated as First-class citizen.
- JavaScript programmers have access to a large number of libraries to perform different tasks.
- It has Cross-platform compatibility.
- JavaScript is a weakly typed language.
- There is a vast community available to seek help if stuck somewhere.


### Note
The file extesion of a JavaScript file is `.js`
We will need a JavaScript engine to run our `.js` file.
