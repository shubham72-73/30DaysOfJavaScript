## Download Node.js
In order to run JavaScript in local machine, first of all you have to download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en). This serves as a JavaScript runtime environment that's means it will allow you to run JavaScript outside the browser.

Node.js is built on top of google chrome V8 engine which is open source by google.

## Step to install
After downloading the NodeJS, now we have to install it in our system.


## Visual Studio Code Editor
NodeJS will provide us the environment to run our JavaScript program. But we still need something to write down our code. This is where we will need VS Code. It is a code editor which allows us to develop programs. You can download it from their website. [Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and install it in your machine.
