Let's understand a problem first before start to understand loops. Imagine that you have to print your name 5 time in JavaScript then how will you do that? ðŸ¤”
Your ans would be something like the following code.
```javascript
console.log("Shivam");
console.log("Shivam");
console.log("Shivam");
console.log("Shivam");
console.log("Shivam");
```
**Note:** JavaScript loops are essential for efficiently handling repetitive tasks. They execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a specified condition remains true.

```javascript
for(let i = 1; i<=5; i++) {
