## Context
I believe before learning anything, you must know the history because if you don't know why this thing exist then you are learning that thing just to complete your tasks.

## History of JavaScript
JavaScript was developed by Brendan Eich in 1995. It was developed for Netscape Navigator (Browser) after it was having a tough competition with Microsoft's Internet Explorer. One interesting fact is that JavaScript was developed in 10 days. 
Javascript is both scripting and programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages. 99% of the websites uses JavaScript as their client-side language. However, it can be used for both Client-Side (Frontend) and Server-Side (Backend).

### Note
The file extesion of a JavaScript file is `.js`
We will need a javaScript engine to run our `.js` file.
