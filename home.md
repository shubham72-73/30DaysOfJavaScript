## How we started?
[Shubham Singh](https://github.com/shubham72-73) and [Shivam Sharma](https://github.com/shivam-sharma7), both final-year BCA students at the time, embarked on a project to develop a comprehensive educational resource aimed at facilitating the learning of JavaScript in an engaging and accessible manner. Recognizing the challenges they faced sourcing information from various platforms during their own learning journey, they endeavored to consolidate their collective knowledge into a cohesive course. This initiative culminated in the creation of "30DaysOfJavaScript", a meticulously crafted documentation-style course designed to empower students with a structured and immersive learning experience in JavaScript.

## What you will learn?
In this self-paced JavaScript course, participants will embark on a comprehensive learning journey spanning from fundamental concepts to advanced techniques, all presented in a highly accessible manner. Our curriculum is meticulously crafted to equip learners with the necessary knowledge to confidently initiate and progress in their JavaScript proficiency. Topics include not only foundational principles but also delve into the intricate workings behind the scenes, such as JavaScript engine functionality and underlying mechanics. Our aim is to provide a holistic understanding of JavaScript, empowering learners to navigate its complexities with ease and confidence.

## Who should learn?
Whether you are an entry-level enthusiast or a seasoned industry professional, our documentation offers valuable insights suitable for individuals at every stage of their JavaScript journey. For those well-versed in the basics, the option to bypass introductory chapters is available, enabling them to delve directly into more advanced topics. Conversely, beginners are warmly welcomed to embark on what we believe to be the premier JavaScript course, meticulously designed to cater to their foundational learning needs.
